# PairProgrammingProject
Pair programming project for Software Dev Course. The goal was to practice test-driven development in pairs.

Simulates a deck of cards. Table class is to simulate having players use the cards. No specific games were to be built on this
code, but there is potential to build games on this code such as poker, so long as the ace has a value of 14 rather than 1.
